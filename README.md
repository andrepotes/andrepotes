My name is André, an Electrical and Computer Engineering specialized in Robotics. 

Currently working at Institute for Systems and Robotics at Instituto Superior Técnico, in Lisbon. The work I am developing alongside my colleagues consists of:
- Developing new Guidance, Navigation and Control software towards expanding our current robotics stack capabilities.
- Maintain old and new software to fit accordingly in our stack.
- Help other investigators/colleagues in their research work and projects where our department is currently enrolled.
- Create new content to spread the word and image of the department.
